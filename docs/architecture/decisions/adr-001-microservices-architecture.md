# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
AIRIS-MON requires a scalable, maintainable architecture that can handle high-throughput AI monitoring workloads while allowing independent development and deployment of different system components.

## Decision
We will adopt a microservices architecture pattern for AIRIS-MON, with the following key services:

1. **Data Ingestion Service** - Handles metrics, events, and log collection
2. **Analytics Engine Service** - Processes data for insights and anomaly detection  
3. **Alert Management Service** - Manages alerting rules and notifications
4. **Configuration Service** - Centralized configuration management
5. **User Interface Service** - Frontend application and API gateway
6. **Authentication Service** - User management and authorization

## Rationale

### Benefits
- **Independent Scaling**: Each service can be scaled independently based on load
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use optimal technology stacks
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can develop and deploy services independently
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't bring down the entire system
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Services can be deployed and updated independently

### Trade-offs Considered
- **Complexity**: Increased operational complexity vs. monolithic architecture
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication overhead
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency vs. immediate consistency
- **Development Overhead**: Additional infrastructure and tooling requirements

## Implementation Details

### Service Boundaries
Services are bounded by business capabilities and data ownership:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│ Data Ingestion  │    │   Analytics     │    │  Alert Manager  │
│                 │    │    Engine       │    │                 │

```

### Communication Patterns
- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for request-response interactions
- **Asynchronous**: Apache Kafka for event-driven communication
- **Real-time**: WebSockets for live dashboard updates

### Data Management
- Each service owns its data and database
- Event sourcing for critical business events
- CQRS pattern for read/write separation where beneficial

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently
- **Resilience**: Fault isolation prevents cascading failures
- **Development Velocity**: Teams can work independently
- **Technology Freedom**: Optimal technology choices per service

### Negative
- **Operational Complexity**: More services to monitor and manage
- **Network Overhead**: Inter-service communication latency
- **Data Consistency**: Managing distributed transactions
- **Testing Complexity**: End-to-end testing challenges

## Monitoring & Observability
- Distributed tracing across service boundaries
- Centralized logging aggregation
- Service-level metrics and SLAs
- Circuit breakers for fault tolerance

## Security Considerations
- Service-to-service authentication using JWT tokens
- API gateway for external security boundary
- Network segmentation and service mesh
- Principle of least privilege for service permissions

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Architecture
**Pros**: Simpler deployment, easier testing, no network latency
**Cons**: Limited scalability, technology lock-in, team bottlenecks
**Decision**: Rejected due to scalability requirements

### Event-Driven Architecture
**Pros**: Excellent decoupling, high scalability
**Cons**: Complex debugging, eventual consistency challenges
**Decision**: Partially adopted - used for async communication between services

### Modular Monolith
**Pros**: Balance between monolith and microservices
**Cons**: Still limited scalability, potential for coupling
**Decision**: Considered for future consolidation if needed

## Migration Strategy
1. Start with a modular monolith structure
2. Extract services based on scaling needs
3. Implement service mesh for communication
4. Gradual migration of existing components

## Review Date
This ADR will be reviewed in 6 months (July 2024) to assess the effectiveness of the microservices approach.
