# AIRIS EPM API Gateway Security Policies

## 🔒 Security Policy Framework

This document outlines the comprehensive security policies and best practices implemented in the AIRIS EPM API Gateway to ensure robust protection of enterprise monitoring data and infrastructure.

## 🛡️ Information Security Principles

### Confidentiality
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with principle of least privilege
- **Data Classification**: Monitoring data classified and handled according to sensitivity levels
- **Key Management**: Secure key generation, rotation, and storage practices

### Integrity
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Request Signing**: API requests validated for tampering
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable audit trails for all security-relevant events
- **Checksums**: Data integrity verification mechanisms

### Availability
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DDoS and abuse
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic failover and recovery mechanisms
- **Load Balancing**: Distributed architecture for high availability
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting

## 🔐 Authentication Policies

### Password Security
```yaml
Requirements:
  - Minimum Length: 12 characters
  - Complexity: Mixed case, numbers, special characters
  - History: Cannot reuse last 12 passwords
  - Expiration: 90 days for regular users, 30 days for privileged accounts
  - Lockout: 5 failed attempts result in 15-minute lockout
  - MFA: Required for admin and operator roles
```

### JWT Token Management
```yaml
Access Tokens:
  - Expiry: 15 minutes default
  - Algorithm: HS256 minimum, RS256 recommended for production
  - Claims: Minimal necessary claims only
  - Revocation: Immediate blacklisting capability

Refresh Tokens:
  - Expiry: 7 days default
  - Rotation: New refresh token issued on each use
  - Storage: Redis with TTL enforcement
  - Binding: Tied to device/session fingerprint
```

### API Key Management
```yaml
Generation:
  - Entropy: Cryptographically secure random generation
  - Format: Prefix-based role identification
  - Length: Minimum 32 characters
  - Scoping: Limited to specific resources/actions

Lifecycle:
  - Creation: Audit logged with user context
  - Usage: Rate limited and monitored
  - Rotation: Recommended every 90 days
  - Revocation: Immediate with audit trail
```

## 🎭 Authorization Policies

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### Role Assignment Rules
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users granted minimum necessary permissions
2. **Separation of Duties**: Critical operations require multiple roles
3. **Role Inheritance**: Higher roles inherit lower role permissions
4. **Time-based Access**: Optional time-limited role assignments
5. **Geographic Restrictions**: Location-based access controls

#### Permission Matrix

| Resource | Guest | Viewer | Analyst | Developer | Operator | Admin | SuperAdmin |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|-------|------------|
| Metrics | Read | Read | Read | Read/Write | Read/Write | Full | Full |
| Logs | - | Read | Read | Read/Write | Read/Write | Full | Full |
| Traces | - | - | Read | Read/Write | Read/Write | Full | Full |
| Alerts | - | Read | Read | Read | Read/Write | Full | Full |
| ETL | - | - | - | Read | Read/Write | Full | Full |
| Gateway | - | - | - | - | - | Admin | Full |
| Registry | - | - | - | - | - | Admin | Full |

#### Dynamic Permission Evaluation
```javascript
// Permission check algorithm
function checkPermission(user, resource, action, context) {
  // 1. Check user role and level
  // 2. Validate resource access
  // 3. Verify action permission
  // 4. Apply contextual restrictions
  // 5. Log access attempt
  // 6. Return decision with audit trail
}
```

## 🌐 Network Security Policies

### Transport Layer Security
```yaml
TLS Configuration:
  - Version: TLS 1.3 minimum, TLS 1.2 fallback
  - Ciphers: AEAD ciphers only (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
  - Key Exchange: ECDHE preferred
  - Certificates: RSA 2048-bit minimum, ECDSA preferred
  - HSTS: Enabled with 1-year max-age
  - Certificate Pinning: Implemented for critical connections
```

### CORS and CSP Policies
```javascript
// CORS Policy
{
  origin: function(origin, callback) {
    const allowedOrigins = process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS.split(',');
    if (!origin || allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
      callback(null, true);
    } else {
      callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'));
    }
  },
  credentials: true,
  optionsSuccessStatus: 200
}

// Content Security Policy
{
  'default-src': ["'self'"],
  'script-src': ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
  'style-src': ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
  'img-src': ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
  'connect-src': ["'self'"],
  'font-src': ["'self'"],
  'frame-ancestors': ["'none'"],
  'base-uri': ["'self'"],
  'form-action': ["'self'"]
}
```

  - Operator: 2000 requests/15min
  - Developer: 1000 requests/15min
  - Viewer: 500 requests/15min
  - Guest: 100 requests/15min

Endpoint-specific:
  - /auth/login: 5 attempts/5min per IP
